          Researchers have proposed that including apples in an otherwise
          healthy and balanced diet may encourage weight loss. In studies in
          women with excess weight who follow a low-calorie or weight-reduction
          diet, apple intake is associated with weight loss (8Trusted Source,
          16Trusted Source). In one study, women regularly ate apples, pears, or
          oat cookies â€” foods with similar fiber and calorie contents. After 12
          weeks, the fruit groups lost 2.7 pounds (1.2 kg), but the oat group
          showed no significant weight loss (16Trusted Source).
